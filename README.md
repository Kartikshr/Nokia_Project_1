<h1>Data Analysis Using Numpy and Pandas</h1>
<p1>This project is a complete study on a dataset consist of the large financial data of a superstore. As we know we can not conclude anything by just seeing that dataset by our naked eyes and untill we can not 
  take that data in use that particular data is a waste for us, so i have applied data science tools for analysing the data and got a detailed insights of that data on the basis of which we can conclude many 
  things and also take our future decisions more precisely.</p1>
