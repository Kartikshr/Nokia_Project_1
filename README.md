<h1>Data Analysis Using Numpy and Pandas</h1>
<p1>This project is a complete study on a dataset consist of the large financial data of a superstore. As we know we can not conclude anything by just seeing that dataset by our naked eyes and untill we can not 
  take that data in use that particular data is a waste for us, so i have applied data science tools for analysing the data and got a detailed insights of that data on the basis of which we can conclude many 
  things and also take our future decisions more precisely.</p1>
<h2>Technologies used in this project</h2>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p1>The data reveals a strong correlation between Profit and Sales. A high profit margin is prevalent, indicating robust business performance with many products being sold at favorable prices. However, there are instances of negative margins, highlighting that some products were sold at a loss.

Analyzing sales trends over time, we observe significant fluctuations. Sales showed a steady upward trend until the end of 2017, followed by a sharp decline. The early months of 2018 represent the lowest sales period in the dataset.

Among all categories, the Technology segment stands out, delivering the highest profit margin compared to the other two categories.</p2>
